Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers. 
These networks are capable of learning complex representations of data such as images, text, and speech. 
Training deep learning models requires large datasets and significant computational power, often using GPUs or TPUs. 
Popular frameworks for deep learning include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. 
Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.
