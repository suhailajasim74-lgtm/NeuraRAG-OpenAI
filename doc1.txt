Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data. 
Reinforcement learning focuses on agents that learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.
Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
